Static Assets

This repository hosts static files (images, logos, banners) used across my GitHub profile and project READMEs.

The main goal of this repository is to provide a single, version-controlled source for all shared media. This prevents link rot from external hosting, ensures assets are always available, and keeps my individual project repositories clean.

How to Use

To use an image from this repository in another README.md file (or on a website), you must use the raw file path, not the standard GitHub repository path.

1.  Navigate to the file you want to use in this repository.
2.  On the file's page, click the **"Download"** button (or right-click "Raw" and select "Copy Link Address").
3.  This will give you a URL starting with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...`
4.  Use this URL as the image source in your Markdown or HTML.

**Example Markdown:**

```markdown
